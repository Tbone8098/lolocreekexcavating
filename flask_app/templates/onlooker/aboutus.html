        <!-- <p class="mt-3">Lolo Creek Excavating, LLC was started by Brandon Williams in the small town of Lolo, Montana. Brandon has worked
            in the excavation industry for over 5 years and has experience in a wide variety of construction and excavation
            applications.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">Always ready to take on a challenge, we are looking to target both the residential and commercial markets in the
            Missoula/Bitterroot Valleys and surrounding areas. We know there is a lack of available excavation companies to
            work on and complete even the smallest projects. That's why our goal at Lolo Creek Excavating is to alleviate
            those issues by providing prompt and excellent service to our local area home and business owners.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">As a new company in the area, we are looking to show the industry that we can't be beat when it comes to customer
            service, willingness to go above and beyond, and dedication to making your current and future projects a
            success.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">Give Brandon a call anytime to chat about your excavation or snow removal needs, and receive a free quote. (406)
